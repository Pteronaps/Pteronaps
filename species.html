<p>Pteronaps have either: feathered, furred, or batty patagium; a type of membrane connecting their forelimbs and hips together. There are, however, occasionally Pteronaps that have other types of patagium; such as that resembling insects. They use these ‘wings’ to glide from tree-to-tree, or just to glide along with the wind to travel short distances.
Every Pteronap has long legs, as well as small feet paws. They use their long legs to help push them up into the air; their legs being incredibly strong and well-built. While their feet paws are sometimes small, they have retractable claws that can come out at will. The claws are long and sharp enough to help them grip onto tree branches and other rough surfaces. Their paw pads are very squishy, and make good padding for landing.</p>

<p>Pteronaps have rings of fur around their necks; though these rings are typically just called manes. During the Spring and Summer, their manes are smaller and thinner, but once it becomes Autumn to Winter, their manes suddenly grow out much larger and thicker! The fur helps keep them warm. Their entire bodies are also covered in fur, even the Pteronaps that have batty or insect patagiums have fur all over their bodies. The body fur tends to be shorter, but still rather thick to help keep them warm during the colder seasons.
Most Pteronaps have large ears to help them hear, and most Pteronaps have large tails to help aid them in steering and jumping, as the larger tails can help push up and propel them into the air along with their strong legs. There are, however, Pteronaps that are born with smaller, or more ‘petitie’ parts. The Pteronaps with these parts tend to have lesser hearing, and less mobility and range when it comes to gliding; most often finding it hard to even glide at all. There are also Pternaps who were born with more 'huge' parts, thus making it especially hard for them to glide due to the parts weighing them down!</p>

<p>​Some Pteronaps also have whiskers on their face, and these can range in size and quantity. A typical whiskered Pteronap has two large whiskers on either side of their cheeks, but Pteronaps can have up to six whiskers at a time. However, the more whiskers a Pteronap has, the more likely it is that the whiskers will be smaller in size.
Pteronaps can also have extra fluff anywhere on their body. It is not trait-related! Same with the whiskers! As an added bonus, Pteronaps have long, bat-like tongues that help them drink the nectar out of fruits, flowers and berries. These tongues are typically split, but can also be just pointed. Their tongue tips are never round!</p>

<p>An odd feature that all Pteronaps have are ‘butt wings’, or wings along the top side of their tail. These wings help push them up into the air, and it especially helps with the Pteronaps with smaller tails! It helps give them an extra boost up into the air! The wings can range in sizes, but are typically rather small. The wings can be larger of course; but the Pteronaps with larger butt wings tend to find it hard to balance themselves when walking around. The wings start to take up too much space on their body, and the Pteronaps with huge parts tend to have to learn to walk differently than normal Pteronaps.
A typical Pteronap is about one and a half feet in size (1 1/2 ft.). Larger Pteronaps exist, but these Naps are extremely rare. A Pteronap can also be smaller, but these are even more rare! Larger and smaller Pteronaps are both called 'unusuals', and there are very few of them in the world!</p>

<h2><b>WATERNAPS:</b></h2>
<p>Waternaps follow the same lore, however, instead of fur, they have smooth skin and very small scales. Where their manes would normally be instead turn into large whisker-like 'hair.' Most Waternaps resemble nudibranches, or seaslugs of multiple kinds! They don't come out of the water often, so things like fur are of no use to them. Unlike Pteronaps, Waternaps have gills, only two toes, and connected tails, arms and butt wings.
Waternaps live in Sepia's Creek and other shallow bodies of water. They are not suited for salt water, and prefer fresh streams and ponds. Their wings and tails are always ray-like, and their ears resemble the Common 'Sprout' Ear trait that Pteronaps have. They always have at least one set of whiskers and gills. They can have maximum 1-4 sets of whiskers, and maximum 1-3 sets of gills. Their whiskers help determine water currents, and their webbed hands help them swim. Their wings also always flare out into two tips, but they may take the shape of any kind of aquatic creature while retaining a ray-like form.</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTES:</b></p>
<P>Pteronaps are also NOT human-sized, nor are they human!
Pteronap anatomy is naturally androgynous, and they do not have any sexual dimorphism seen in other species such as humans. They can express themselves in any gender, but don't have defining physical gender characteristics. This includes breasts, etc.</P>

<p>Pteronaps do not live in big cities on their own unless they are a pet, etc. They are primarily in forests, zoos/sanctuaries, or in general nature!</p>

<p><b>Please avoid using any references to pop culture and already existing brands in your Pteronap's design and clothing; as well as not making your Pteronaps based off of canon characters.
Thank you!</p></b>

            <p>Pteronaps, in general, are very mischievous creatures. They tend to be pests to the other creatures living in the forest, stealing from their food stashes and hoarding whatever they find. Pteronaps are natural hoarders, and each one has their own small stash of food and collectibles. Most Pteronaps- as a small community- are nice to each other.
However- due to their natural mischievous and sometimes bratty nature- they do tend to also ‘bully’ one another. Some like to pick fights, while there are most who would prefer to stay silent and in the corner.</p>
<p>As a whole, Pteronaps are very much communal creatures, and a single Pteronap tends to not do good alone. Most Pteronaps behave rather schemingly, a lot of them being excellent at taking things and deceiving others. Most Naps tend to be up to no good, but there are the few that are calmer and more collected; but those are typically few in a commune. When not being watched, a Nap can go about and steal things and cause havoc. Best to not let your Pteronap out of sight!</p>
          
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3a00f2_ff1a36e35e084d5dad4a553e0dfb6128~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_768,h_384,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/3a00f2_ff1a36e35e084d5dad4a553e0dfb6128~mv2.png" alt="" height="384" width="768"></p>
 <p>Pteronaps live in small communes, about a hundred or less per commune. Most Pteronaps live in dense forests, hiding away behind the trees and under the grassy floors. Most find homes inside of thick trees, while others can live in small burrows underneath the ground; it all depends on the Nap! Other Pteronaps live near farms, where they are known to steal from gardens, and be a general nuisance to the farmers! They find the free sources of food to be quite worth it!
Pteronaps typically live in colder areas that still experience seasons, while they primarily avoid hotter regions. When it rains, Pteronaps living in the ground have to flee and join in with the Naps living in the trees; rain being a major inconvenience in a Pteronap community. This goes for snow as well, since snow can cover up their already established holes in the ground; Naps having to dig themselves out a new entrance!</p>
<p>In a more established Pteronap community, they will use their skills and resources to build small huts and nests where they will cuddle in and hide themselves. These Naps are much better at building than regular, smaller Pteronap communities, and tend to have more established living situations than normal Naps.</p>
<p>There are also many Pteronap sanctuaries that home all kinds of Naps. These facilities can also be rehabilitation centers, etc.
The Naps that live in those places are well-fed, and well-loved!</p>
           
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3a00f2_ca9611aba5a74976bb987060bb5a1997~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_750,h_375,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/3a00f2_ca9611aba5a74976bb987060bb5a1997~mv2.png" alt="" height="384" width="768"></p>
    <p>A Pteronap's primary diet is nectar from trees, fruits and flowers. They can also eat vegetables, but prefer different types of sweet nectar and fruits.
Pteronaps are more traditional with what they eat, and don’t really make things like sandwiches and other complex foods that humans make. They use their long tongues to stick inside of a fruit or into a tree to slurp up the nectar. Sometimes they collect nectar and store it into small bags that they make with leaves and other things that can be found on the forest floors.
They are good at stashing away pretty much any kind of food for later! A commune will have one large area of food to share, while each individual Nap will have their own small stash.</p>
<p>Their favorite food is a special berry called a Star Berry! There has also been a new type of berry discovered called the 'Mimic Berry!' These berries mimic the shape and look of a strawberry, but they taste incredibly bitter! Many Pteronaps hate them! The whole goal of the berry is to attach its seeds to a Nap's fur coat, so that when the Nap flies around, the seeds for the berry's bush will be spread across the land!</p>        
            
<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3a00f2_6ce8fde76aa6467fb9bd0c72edaf0f69~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_786,h_393,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/3a00f2_6ce8fde76aa6467fb9bd0c72edaf0f69~mv2.png" alt="" height="384" width="768"></p>
    <p>Pteronaps typically grow up in small families, a couple typically only having one to two children in their lifetime. Pteronaps mate for life, and will always stick by their partner's side no matter what. Families are normally very tight; each Nap being very close to one another. The Naps, of course, still like to occasionally play rough and beat up on each other; be it family or not! A Pteronap can live for up to a hundred years, although only few are lucky enough to be able to live that long. A typical Pteronap will live up to 70 years. If you have a Pteronap as a pet, it is recommended that you put them in your will in case they outlive you!
A mother will be pregnant with her baby for a little under six months, though it can be longer or shorter for some mothers. </p>
<p>A Pteronap’s childhood is typically a rocky one due to the harsh seasons and the brattiness of other Naps. Mothers try their best to shield and protect their children from the harsh elements of the outside world, and the rudeness of different Naps. Most female Naps tend to become more loving and caring once raising a young one; the fathers becoming much more calmer as well.
A baby Pteronap requires lots of food and attention. Most baby Naps come out almost naked, just having light fuzz if anything! So the parents need to do their absolute best to keep them shielded from the outside world and its weather in their young years. At around a few years old, the baby Pteronaps became capable of walking and gliding; now being fully furred or feathered, and being able to go outside to explore and play. They still need to have a constant eye on them, however!
 Most Pteronaps will not have children until well into their adult years; most finding the thought of having children to be much beyond them.</p>
<p>A Pteronap's life in general is rather rocky, with many ups and downs; most coming from the outside world itself, or occasionally within the commune.
Pteronaps tend to not catch illnesses unless it is stress-related. Most Naps end up dying from old age or lack of care for themselves. Death is not painful for Pteronaps dying of old age, as it tends to happen in their sleep. Pteronaps who are sick tend to experience some pain, but their body naturally fights it off before they pass.</p>       

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3a00f2_6789e884a112491faf4cddba2a953afa~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_766,h_384,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/3a00f2_6789e884a112491faf4cddba2a953afa~mv2.png" alt="" height="384" width="768"></p>
<p>When Pteronaps choose a partner, they will perform a simple courtship dance to woo their partner. The dances often consist of a lot of hip movements, and some like to even shake their butts for fun! Most males often show dominance displays, while some are more simple and just try to impress the female with simple dance moves! A lot of male Pteronaps have fun when they perform their courtship dances, every Nap having a different ‘signature’ dance. When their partner is chosen, they will mate and have a single baby at a time. Female Pteronaps are only pregnant for about six months or so, the length of their pregnancy depending on the weather and their current diets, etc.
As stated above: Pteronaps mate for life, and choose one special partner to love and have children with.</p>
<p>A Pteronap is typically very picky when it comes to partners, a female needing to accept the male before anything can even happen. In a relationship, it is typically the female who chooses which male she wants and not the other way around. When a pair is made, their family celebrates and makes special treats for the new couple. Their rituals are very laid-back, and are always focused around the new couple in question. Most Pteronap families encourage the new couple to have a child to keep the commune strong, and some couples will. There are still a decent handful of couples who choose to not have a child, and would much rather spend all of their time with their partner!
If one of the partners dies, the newly widowed/widower Pteronap will never become mates with another Nap. Since they mate for life, they would feel like they would be cheating if they went on to go with another mate. The Pteronaps that are left alone always stay alone; and if they have children, they will spend the rest of their life with just their children and families.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
There can of course be same-sex couple Pteronaps! What is written here is just for the general male and female scenario, but a Pteronap that is attracted to a Nap of the same sex can also choose to become their mate! Female Naps that fall in love with another female Nap, one of the females will become the dominant and choose to perform a courtship dance for the other female. Two male Naps tend to dance to each other!
Same-sex Pteronap couples will never have children unless they adopt one from another family that cannot take care of theirs, or if they find an abandoned baby.</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3a00f2_5a619811a5a34f2ea2cc27f08d546396~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_749,h_374,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/3a00f2_5a619811a5a34f2ea2cc27f08d546396~mv2.png" alt="" height="384" width="768"></p>
<p>Pteronaps speak in a variety of purring, chirping and clicking sounds; each purr, chirp and click sounding just a bit different from the other. They also tend to speak through many facial expressions alongside the sounds. Purring comes from deep in their throat, while clicking comes more-so from their mouths. Chirping also comes from their throat. They click with their tongue, making a variety of sounds depending on the force and angle their tongue is at. The purring is typically mood-based, and is especially used to communicate happiness and contentedness.
While Pteronaps use both of these to speak, some Naps prefer one over the other; while every Nap naturally uses facial expressions to communicate.</p>
 

<p><b>Note:</b>
You can have your Nap use actual language if you so wish in your stories!</p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3a00f2_9c33e6978d87476aacf71ce5813d5df2~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_749,h_375,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/3a00f2_9c33e6978d87476aacf71ce5813d5df2~mv2.png" alt="" height="384" width="768"></p>
 <p>Fashion is a silly topic, as Pteronaps typically do not wear anything! They are perfectly covered up with their own fluff, and tend not to feel embarrassed about anything! Though there are some who wonder what it would be like to wear these things called clothes, and then make small ornaments and sometimes bags out of leaves and other things you could find from the forest or habitat they reside in.</p>

<p>​<b>Note:</b>
Though- of course- that is just for typical Naps! Your Pteronap may wear any clothing that they want to realistically, such as: coats, hats, scarves, charms around their tails, and other such simple things! Shoes, boots, shirts and some hoodies are some things Naps would not wear!
Pteronaps are primarily wild animals, but you are allowed to dress your Nap up how you please!

<b>Just, please, NO pop culture or actual brands in your Pteronap's clothing!</b></p>

<p><b>Some design rules for making a Pteronap:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Their tongues can either be pointed or split, never round.</li>
  <li>Their pupils can be any shape besides round.</li>
  <li>A Pteronap must always have a mane unless you use a Special Trait Coin.</li>
  <li>The butt wings must always match the arm wings! Overall, the wings count as one singular trait since they have to match. For example, if you chose bat arm wings, your Pteronap must have bat butt wings. No mixing and matching here!</li>
  <li>A Pteronap is only about 1 1/2 feet in size! They are not human-sized, nor are they human!</li>
  <li>A Pteronap's tongue is the same color as their iris!</li>
