            <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
            <p>The Pteronaps species is a CLOSED species created and owned by Locke and kikos. Pteronaps are only titled as “official made” if created by Locke and/or kikos. Guest artists do not count for official designs.
As a closed species, you may only make your own with an obtained MYO Slot.</p>


<p>Official Pteronaps are obtainable through auctions, flat sales, and raffles.
A Pteronap does not become officially owned by the buyer until fully paid for. Failure for payment in an auction or a flat sale will result in a warning, and can lead up to you being banned from the species if there are further issues.</p>


<p><b>If you are found breaking the rules:</b></p>
<p>Although Locke and kikos do not have the right to take a design from someone, the Pteronap owned will instead be removed from the species group, and will not be associated with Pteronaps whatsoever. The user themselves will also be banned. You will also not be allowed to participate in any Pteronap related events after being banned.</p>

 

<b>When owning a Pteronap, you may not:</b>
<li>Claim the species as your own</li>
<li>Use your Pteronap for commercial purposes</li>
<li>Merge it with another species/make hybrids</li>
<li>Make any race/religion/political based artwork featuring a Pteronap</li>
<li>Use any pop culture references in either your Pteronap's design or clothing- this includes making Pteronaps designed after canon characters</li>
<li>Make NSFW artwork of your Pteronaps in any way</li>
                </ol>
                
        </BR>
            <h1 class="text-primary mb-3">Documentation</h1>
            <ol class="ml-4 mb-0">
            <p>All Pteronaps are uploaded and documented on this website. ONLY official and Guest Artist Pteronaps will have their traits listed. Pteronap profiles will be kept track of privately off-site. This site also stores player inventories and the item catalogue.</p>

<p>Please do not delete your Pteronaps off of ToyHouse, please always keep their profiles up for private masterlist tracking purposes.</p>
<p><b>You are now REQUIRED to PM kikos on ToyHouse for masterlist changes.</b></p>

<p>The masterlist is the only way that Pteronaps are considered real. If your Pteronap is not on the masterlist, but you know that you made it legally, please contact kikos with the design so that it can be uploaded.</p>
<p>kikos primarily uploads new Pteronaps in batches, but please allow up to 2-3 days for your Pteronap to be uploaded onto the site.</p>

<p>Pteronaps can be voided, but the traits that make them a Pteronap must be changed! And they must be turned into a regular design with no obvious relation to the species. See the F.A.Q page for more information.</p>
<p>All MYO Pteronaps must be shown to kikos before approval; please do not forget to send your Pteronaps in after you have created them!</p>

            <p>If you back out of a payment, this will result in a temporary ban from purchasing any type of Pteronap from the species. Please only bid/buy
